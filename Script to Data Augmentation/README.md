Due to the complexity of the detection, a robust model is required. For this reason, an extensive augmentation of the consolidated dataset was performed.

## Augmentations

- Grid Dropout (Albumentations).
- Colors (Detectron2)
- Rotations (Detectron2)

#### Dataset augmentation: Grid Dropout

For the Grid Dropout augmentation we used the Albumentations library, because it is not implemented in Detectron2.

### Dataset augmentation: Colors

This code modifies:
(+/-) brightness
(+/-) contrast
(+/-) saturation
(+/-) gamma
for each image.

### Dataset augmentation: Rotations

The rotations were from 45ยบ to -45ยบ, each 5ยบ a rotation was made for a total of 19 rotations of the dataset.
